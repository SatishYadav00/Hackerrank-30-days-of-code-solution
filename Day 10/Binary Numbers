Task
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

Example
n=125
The binary representation of 125 is 1111101. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum,5 .

Input Format

A single integer,n .


Output Format

Print a single base-10 integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n.

Sample Input 1

5
Sample Output 1

1
Sample Input 2

13
Sample Output 2

2
Explanation

Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of 5 is 101 , so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1.

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of 13 is 1101 , so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 2.
