# Task  
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in elememts and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in the editor reads in 2 lines of input. The first line contains N, the size of the elements array. The second line has N space-separated integers that describe the elements array.

Constraints

, where 
#  Output Format

You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the value of the maximumDifference instance variable.

# Sample Input
